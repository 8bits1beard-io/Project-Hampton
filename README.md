# Project: Hampton v0.0.1

Learn AI-Assisted Development Through Building Real Projects

## About

Project: Hampton is an interactive educational platform that teaches "vibe coding" - the art of building software with AI assistants like Claude Code and Code Puppy. Through hands-on project-based learning, gamification, and a supportive curriculum, students learn to leverage AI tools to build real, functional applications.

Named in honor of Tom Hampton, a 5th grade teacher at Cleveland Elementary School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, this project embodies the teaching philosophy that learning should be an adventure, mistakes are opportunities, and everyone can succeed with the right guidance.

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` and use `index2.html`

## Progress Code System

Your progress is saved using retro NES-era style codes like:
```
HAMPTON-TICT-W3M2-K9Q7-X8F2  (Tic-Tac-Toe)
HAMPTON-SNOW-W2M4-M3K8-F9Q1  (ServiceNow)
HAMPTON-AUTO-W4M1-P7L2-N6X9  (Automation)
HAMPTON-MSFT-W1M3-G4H7-R8S5  (Microsoft Graph)
```

These codes contain:
- Your chosen project path (TICT/SNOW/AUTO/MSFT)
- Current week and module position
- Completed achievements
- XP and skill progression

*"One looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feelings. The curriculum is so much necessary raw material, but warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child."*  
— Carl Jung
